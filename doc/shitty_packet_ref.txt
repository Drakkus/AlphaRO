Ahira's RO Packet Doc v0.15
So far discovered from checking RagEmu's source - if you can read code you can 
figure this stuff out as much as I have.
Big thanks and props to Mibz, Likefire and Lunar5 for adding sections for 
packets I haven't fucked with yet.

6 - ?? Some sort of timer or timer response ?? 
7 - 'char data (Quote from code) 
D - 'char selected (Quote from code)
F - 'cur pos 
06 = someone in your party next to you recovering hp (Acefalo) 
08 - *SEND* message(party) (Frost2)

18 - ?? Additional monster packet? Code resembles 17 ?? 
1B - ?? Data ?? 
1C - Death of Monster or Player 
1D - ?? Timer ?? 
23 - ?? Item drop packet ?? - seems to continue fighting or go to pickup item 
25 - Action packet (Stand/Sit)
26 - Damage packet - ?? Player or Monster ?? 
29 - Local chat packet (Different then 2A) 
2A - Local chat packet (Different then 29) 
2D - Essentially, this is sent to you when your character is now heading to 
another area that is ON THE SAME server. That means you either: A) Warped Away 
by An acolyte B) Use a Teleport function built-in to the bot (which I added to 
mine), or C) Hit a Return to Save Point button (which I added to mine). (Lunar5) 

2E - Essentially, this is sent to you when your character is now heading to 
another area that is ON ANOTHER server. That means you either: A) Warped Away by 
An acolyte B) Hit a Return to Save Point button (which I added to mine). 
(Lunar5) 
30 - Accessing a vending merchant (Mibz) 
33 - Incoming whisper packet 
36 - I've noticed that whenever God-Poing speaks, this is the header received by 
the RO client. That's basically all I can say regarding this. (Lunar5) 
38 - ?? Data ?? 
39 - ?? Data ?? 
3A - New item dropped packet 
3C - ?? Data ?? 
3D - Item removed from game world packet (Picked up by something) 
3F - This heads the packets that tell you what items are on your character, 
EXCLUDING equipped items. (Lunar5) - See bottom for example 1 explination. 
40 - Same as Case 3F, cept this data tells you what items you have EQUIPPED on 
yourself. (Lunar5) 
4B - This is sent to you in response to your client having sent to the server a 
request to use Warp Portal. Starting at byte 11, and for a total length of 16 
bytes, is the first area which the server has saved for your Warp Portal. The 
name of the area is in ASCII, followed by 00 bytes in the length of the name of 
the area is less than 16 characters. Next, starting at byte 27 is the 2nd area 
which the server has saved for your warp. Last, at byte 43 is the 3rd area. Now, 
if one has lvl 8 Warp (which means only one area saved), it'll send ya that one 
area, then, in place of the other 2 areas, instead of the names, it's all 00 
bytes. The total length of this data is 58 bytes. (Lunar5) - See Note 1 at the 
bottom for a trick with using this. 
4C - Character info change stat (HP/MAXHP/SP/MAXSP/WEIGHT/MAXWEIGHT) 
4D - Character info change stat (XP/J-XP/XPMAX/J-XPMAX) 
4F - ?? Data ??

A5 - Party Chat packet 
A7 - Use Item (Likefire)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Example 1 - Reading the recieved inventory packets (written by Lunar5): 
You recieve this: A3 00 09 01 0F 0A 05 00 28 00 00 00 00 00 41 72 72 6F 77 14 0A 
06 00 16 00 00 00 00 00 46 69 72 65 5F 41 72 72 6F 77 14 00 09 00 01 00 00 00 00 
00 57 68 69 74 65 Ok, A3 - 64 = 3F, which everyone should've been able to figure 
out for themselves. Now, notice the 5th byte sent, 0F. Just remember this value. 
Now, notice the 9th packet, 28. This is the item quantity of the upcoming item. 
If we now scroll down to the 15th byte, we have the Item's name, in ASCII. Here, 
it is merely "Arrow". Now, remember that 5th byte, 0F, F = 15, right? Now, move 
15 from this 5th byte (means we'll be looking at the 20th byte), this byte 
happens to be the first byte after the end of the items name. This byte's value 
is 14, which = 20. If we now go 20 from this byte, we'll notice it's the first 
byte after the end of another item's name, and so on. I believe the 6th and 7th 
bytes are the first item's "ID", which changes often when you log on, which 
would explain why when healing from Red Pots, the same bytes aren't always sent 
to the server. Lastly, take a look at bytes 3 and 4. It's 09 01. Now, let's 
switch these 2 bytes around to get 01 09. This value now, 0109, is the length in 
bytes of the entire non-equipped item data that is currently being sent to you. 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------ 
Note 1 - Warp Portal (written by Lunar5): 
On a side note, there's a very interesting thing regarding Warp Portal. When you 
send the original Warp Portal request (the first packet you send out), there are 
5 bytes that are always unique: 1 is the lvl of your Warp Portal, 2 of them 
represent the X coordinate you want the portal cast on, and 2 represent the Y 
coordinate you want the portal cast on. I actually exploited this recently with 
the bot, allowing me to cast Warp Portal ANYWHERE on the current map I was on, 
without having to be near that place, by merely exploiting the bytes that tell 
the server where to place the Warp Portal.

Notes taken from conversations to be worked into better descriptions above
<Frost2> i wrote down some packets that nobody will probably ever use
<Frost2> 8C - message(out loud)
<Frost2> 96 - message(private)
<Frost2> 08 - message(party)
<Frost2> thats sending to server
<Ahira> yeah I need to put a better descrip on which packets are for sending and 
which are for recieving
<Ahira> lemmie throw those in
<Frost2> k
<Frost2> i got the sit down and stand up packets if you want those :P

<Mibz> D9 is entering a chatroom
<Ahira> sure, I'm trying to recreate the all-knowing packet doc so lemmie know
<Frost2> k
<Frost2> 89 00 00 00 00 00 03 - Stand
<Frost2> 89 00 00 00 00 00 02 - Sit
<Mibz> Woah, hold up
<Mibz> The hell...
<Frost2> :P
<Mibz> NEvermind about D9
<Frost2> lol
<Frost2> donno how to shorten stand and sit
<Ahira> looks like 89 is an action packet then, with a state variable being 
passed
<Frost2> yeah
<Frost2> i got all the emotion packets down except the ctrl+ ones lol
<Ahira> thats pure packet that hasen't been converted so it's 25 for the header 
right?
<Mibz> Okay, yeah. D9 enters a chat room. Format is D9 00 xx xx 00 00 00 00 00 
00 00 00 00 00
<Ahira> stand/sit I'm talking about
<Mibz> D9 isn't converted
<Mibz> Uh, the header wouldn't be 25
<Frost2> thats the whole packet
<Frost2> being sent
<Mibz> Hrmm
<Mibz> nm
<Mibz> 25 would be
<Ahira> waitaminute - H89 - H64 = H25 by my calc ... am I fucking this up?
<Frost2> mibz dont worry im a newbie at packets too lol

<eVo]uT[oN> !fs 
<Mibz> Ahira, no you're not
<Frost2> 89-64=25
<Mibz> At first glance I didn't think it would be
<Mibz> Frost, we're talking hex here
*** Hirro (POPORING@d150-116-138.home.cgocable.net) has joined #thegleek.com
<Frost2> then what am i talking about lol
<Mibz> But yeah. For chat rooms
<Mibz> Decimal
<Ahira> yeah, I'm using the scientific calc, so unless I'm missing something I 
should be doing this right
<Frost2> should i start using hex from now on
<Mibz> D9 00 xx 23 all the zeroes
<Ahira> (of course on hex mode)
<eVo]uT[oN> anybody got korean ID generator ????
<Frost2> lol
<Mibz> xx is unique on the chat room

<Ahira> yo
<Mibz> Okay
<Mibz> Chat room packets. Made easy
<Mibz> D9 00 xx 23 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00
<Mibz> xx is unique on chat room
<Mibz> E3 00 closes the chat
<Mibz> Gimme a sec and I'll sniff send/recv for talking in chat
<Ahira> k
<Mibz> Hrmmm
<Mibz> Nothing received
<Mibz> Only sent
<Mibz> The other guy even talked...
<Ahira> but again those aren't adjusted with the H64 right? so it's D9-64=75 
right?
<Mibz> Right
<Mibz> Okay, for talking in chat
<Mibz> 8C is unadjusted header
<Mibz> 8C 00 10 00 4D 69 62 7A 20 3A 20 62 6C 61 68 00
<Mibz> xx xx xx xx M I B Z : b l a h
<Mibz> Now
<Mibz> the 3rd byte changed each time
<Ahira> I'm copying all this to the bottom of the doc to decipher later to make 
sure I get it right
<Mibz> Actually
<Mibz> hold up
<Mibz> Okay
<Mibz> 3rd byte represents your message length
<Ahira> no problem, I'm not actually adding this stuff in yet, just making logs 
of whats told to me about this so I can clean it up and organize it later
<Mibz> 0D = 1 char
<Mibz> 0E = 2 chars
<Mibz> etc
<Ahira> I see it
<Mibz> In my example it's 10 representing 4 chars. B L A H
<Ahira> woah wait a sec hehe listin to this
<Ahira> in that example...
<Ahira> 10 would be the message length
<Ahira> MIBZ : blah
<Ahira> now thats 11 characters... but counting 00 as one character, 10 would = 
11
<Mibz> Yup
<Mibz> Right
<Mibz> Oh shit
<Mibz> *Smack*
<Ahira> lol
<Mibz> 3rd byte includes your name
<Ahira> u see it ;)
<Ahira> <Mibz> In my example it's 10 representing 4 chars. B L A H
<Ahira> is wrong then :)
<Ahira> 10 represents your whole name, the spaces, colon and messahe
<Mibz> SEND-> 0000 8C 00 0E 00 4D 69 62 7A 20 3A 20 62 62 00 ....Mibz : bb.
<Mibz> 0E = 14
<Ahira> correct :)
<Mibz> And the 4 bytes infront
<Mibz> The length of the packet itself
<Mibz> So we've got 8C xx Length xx Name : message.
<Mibz> and E3 00 closes the chat
<Mibz> ON TO VENDING MERCHANTS
<Ahira> lol
<Ahira> this is pretty fun hehehe who said reverse enginerring wouldn't get u 
anywhere lol
<Mibz> SEND-> 0000 30 01 11 B6 03 00 0.....
<Mibz> SEND-> 0000 30 01 39 B1 01 00 0.9...

<Mibz> Two merchs, second is 6 units left and 1 unit up from first one
<Mibz> I don't see position in there anywhere
<Mibz> I see three random bytes
<Ahira> Length ^ ^ ^
<Ahira> bah that got all formated wrong
<Mibz> SEND-> 0000 30 01 F7 51 02 00 0..Q..
<Mibz> SEND-> 0000 30 01 34 55 04 00 0.4U..
<Ahira> well 1,2,6 columns are static it seemd for merchants
<Mibz> Yup
<Mibz> 30 01 xx xx xx 00
<Mibz> xx xx xx can remain unknown for the time being
<Mibz> I hope you're getting all this :)
<Ahira> If I'm not, I've already got it added to the bottom of the doc ;)
<Mibz> Okay
<Mibz> On to buying from vending merchs
<Ahira> I'm hard copying all this talk into the doc as we go over it.... I'll 
clean it up in a bit
<Ahira> for now just fire awayinfo and I'll help decipher what I can... and make 
sure the doc's gonna get a piece of this
<Ahira> u need me to work with you on this?
<Mibz> I just want all this in one place
<Ahira> I got a merchant with pretty high skills (although blacklisted on ro.pak 
lol
<Mibz> Nah, I got it with 16z pots
<Mibz> SEND-> 0000 34 01 0C 00 BD 38 05 00 01 00 02 00 4....8......
<Mibz> SEND-> 0000 34 01 0C 00 BD 38 05 00 02 00 02 00 4....8......
<Mibz> Now
<Mibz> 4th from last byte = quantity
<Mibz> First I bought 1 red, then 2
<Mibz> Lemme try buying two different items now
<Ahira> <heh and I thought I was done with the doc for tonight :P > well least 
we are getting a great start ;)
<Mibz> Anytime you wanna leave, no problem. Just send me the htm file and I'll 
update it and send it to you tomorrow
<Mibz> I've been wanting to do this for awhile and am completely willing to put 
in some work
<Ahira> naw I'm here bro, but a little woozy ;) drugs are bad <-south park
<Ahira> and I'd love to get as much info as we can in this so understanding what 
to send and what to recieve is a piece of cake
<Ahira> and btw bro, I'll be here at least another 2 hours, so lets knock some 
of this stuff out
<Ahira> :)
<Mibz> SEND-> 0000 34 01 0C 00 70 02 03 00 01 00 05 00 4...p.......
<Mibz> SEND-> 0000 34 01 0C 00 70 02 03 00 01 00 04 00 4...p.......
<Mibz> SEND-> 0000 34 01 0C 00 70 02 03 00 02 00 05 00 4...p.......
<Mibz> Okay here we go
<Mibz> 2nd to last byte is position of item in vending slot
<Mibz> NOW
<Mibz> 02 is the first position
<Mibz> SEND-> 0000 30 01 70 02 03 00 0.p...
<Mibz> That's the merchant access packet. Notice any similarities?
<Mibz> 34 01 0C 00 is the header
<Mibz> 70 02 02 00 is the merchant ID
<Mibz> 01 is the quantity
<Mibz> 05 is the item position
<Mibz> We have successfully decoded buying from vending merchants
<Mibz> Just gotta find out if it can be sent from anywhere
<Ahira> ok (whew got all that down as a record)
<Mibz> Time for NPC buying
<Mibz> Sec
<Ahira> sure lol.... I'm like 1/2 figuring all this out but then I keep having 
to update the doc - Iwant to use your descriptions of this
<Mibz> <Mibz> 34 01 0C 00 is the header
<Mibz> <Mibz> 70 02 02 00 is the merchant ID
<Mibz> <Mibz> 01 is the quantity
<Mibz> <Mibz> 05 is the item position
<Mibz> That's all you need
<Mibz> With 34 01 0C 00 70 02 03 00 01 00 05 00 4...p.......
<Mibz> As the example packet
<Mibz> Okay, for NPCs
<Mibz> SEND-> 0000 9B 00 00 ...
<Mibz> SEND-> 0000 90 00 96 CB 00 00 01 .......
<Mibz> SEND-> 0000 C5 00 96 CB 00 00 00 .......
<Mibz> First two enter vendor
<Mibz> Last one selects "Buy" as the deal type
<Mibz> They really aren't neccessary
<Ahira> ok, lemmie ask this - why in the merchant is bit 3 different then in the 
example , where bit 7 is...
<Mibz> ????
<Ahira> k check this
<Ahira> <Mibz> 34 01 0C 00 is the header
<Ahira> <Mibz> <Mibz> 70 02 02 00 is the merchant ID
<Ahira> example : 34 01 0C 00 70 02 03 00 01 00 05 00
<Mibz> That should be 70 02 03 00
<Mibz> Human error
<Ahira> ok so that should have been a 3... gotcha - I saw the number not match 
up and it threw me
<Mibz> I manually typed 70 02 03 00 and it was a typo
<Mibz> Sorry
<Mibz> Didn't even notice
<Ahira> hehe sok, I just want to make sure we get this right
<Mibz> C8 is buying from npc. It's a long one too
<Mibz> SEND-> 0000 C8 00 1E 00 01 00 52 65 64 5F 50 6F 74 69 6F 6E

<Mibz> SEND-> 0010 74 69 6F 6E 00 00 52 00 68 FE 53 00 FF FF tion..R.h.S...
<Mibz> Okay
<Mibz> In order I bought: 1 red, 2 red, 1 scarlet, 2 scarlet
<Mibz> It seems that the useful info ends at potion
<Mibz> C8 00 1E 00 Quantity 00 Item Name
<Mibz> What bothers me is how the endings of 2 red and 1 scarlet are the same 
while red 1 and scarlet 2 are completely different
<Ahira> thats probably the inventory control number
<Mibz> SEND-> 0000 7E 00 1E CD AA 06 ~.....

<Ahira> ever run beta6 and watch how the the location #'s it assigns items you 
pick go to 255 before going back through the unused #'s?
<Mibz> Yup
<Mibz> I hated that
<Mibz> In my version it would start at the first free spot
<Ahira> thats how I plan it too - not worth the risk to get an off by 1 error 
there
<Mibz> SEND-> 0000 7E 00 75 D1 AC 06 ~.u...
<Mibz> SEND-> 0000 C8 00 1E 00 01 00 52 65 64 5F 50 6F 74 69 6F 6E

<Mibz> Godamn these npc packets suck
<Mibz> I don't get it
<Mibz> Woah
<Mibz> Nevermind the 7E packet
<Mibz> It's useless!
<Mibz> SEND-> 0000 C8 00 1E 00 01 00 52 65 64 5F 50 6F 74 69 6F 6E

<Mibz> I got that this time though
<Mibz> I need to figure out why....
<Mibz> Why are they different
<Mibz> At least we've got C8 00 as the header
<Mibz> and byte 5 as the quantity
<Ahira> the 0010 block... I see what you mean
<Mibz> Funny thing is. It's always the same length. red potion is same length as 
scarlett
<Mibz> Scarlet just carried over into 0010. But nothing changes...
<Mibz> Hey hey!
<Mibz> SEND-> 0000 90 00 95 CB 00 00 01 .......
<Mibz> SEND-> 0000 90 00 94 CB 00 00 01 .......
<Mibz> Accessing an npc
<Mibz> 90 00 = Header
<Mibz> 95 = NPC ID
<Mibz> CB 00 00 01 = Who knows
<Mibz> CB 00 00 01 = Who knows
<Mibz> CB might also be part of the ID
<Mibz> But for every NPC in izlude it's CB
<Ahira> hmmm I'm lookin over it
<Mibz> SEND-> 0000 C8 00 1E 00 01 00 43 6F 74 74 6F 6E 5F 53 68 69

<Ahira> I'm thinking CB 00 00 01 might be checksum or a variable thats used for
